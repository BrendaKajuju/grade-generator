# JavaScript WEEK 1 Code Challenges

This project is a collection of JavaScript code challenges that include a student grade calculator, a speed detector, and a net salary calculator. These challenges were designed to test and improve the participants' understanding of JavaScript fundamentals such as variables, conditionals, and functions.

## Description

The JavaScript code challenges in this project provide practical experience with real-world problems and help the user to develop a deeper understanding of JavaScript concepts. Each challenge is designed to test and improve the user's understanding of a particular JavaScript topic, such as input validation, conditional statements, or mathematical operations.

The project contains three forms that each perform a different JavaScript code challenge:

### Student Grade Calculator

The student pushgrade calculator allows the user to input their marks and receive their grade. The JavaScript code checks the input for validity and outputs the grade to the user if it is within a valid range. This challenge helps to improve the user's understanding of input validation and conditional statements.

### Speed Detector

The speed detector allows the user to input their speed and receive their demerit points if they are speeding. The JavaScript code checks the input for validity and calculates the demerit points based on the speed. If the demerit points exceed a certain limit, the user's license is suspended. This challenge helps to improve the user's understanding of mathematical operations and conditional statements.

### Net Salary Calculator

The net salary calculator allows the user to input their monthly basic salary and benefits, and receive their net salary after taxes and deductions. The JavaScript code calculates the paye, nhif, and nssf deductions based on the input and outputs the net salary to the user. This challenge helps to improve the user's understanding of mathematical operations and functions.

## Project Setup
