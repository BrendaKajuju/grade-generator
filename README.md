# CODE CHALLENGE

This code challenge involves creating a program that prompts the user to input student marks and then outputs the correct grade based on the input. The program will be written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## HTML

The HTML code will contain a form with input fields that allow the user to enter the student marks. The form will also contain a submit button that triggers the JavaScript function to calculate the student's grade.

## CSS

The CSS code will be used to style the form and make it visually appealing. The CSS code will also be used to style the output of the program.

## JavaScript

The JavaScript code will be responsible for calculating the student's grade based on the input. It will retrieve the input values from the form, perform the necessary calculations, and output the correct grade.

The JavaScript code will first check if the input is between 0 and 100. If the input is valid, the code will proceed to calculate the grade using the following criteria:

- A: greater than 79
- B: 60 to 79
- C: 50 to 59
- D: 40 to 49
- E: less than 40

Once the grade has been calculated, the JavaScript code will output the result to the user.

Overall, this code challenge involves creating a program that prompts the user to input student marks and then outputs the correct grade based on the input. The program will be written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the JavaScript code responsible for performing the necessary calculations and outputting the correct grade.
